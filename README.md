libcluster_ecs
==============

This is an EC2 clustering strategy for
[libcluster](https://hexdocs.pm/libcluster/). It supports identifying nodes
running in Amazon ECS using the awsvpc networking mode. This mode gives each
instance its own IP address.

This strategy uses [ex_aws](https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws) to
query the describe services and describe task APIs. Access to this API should
be granted to the. See the ExAws docs for additional configuration options.
